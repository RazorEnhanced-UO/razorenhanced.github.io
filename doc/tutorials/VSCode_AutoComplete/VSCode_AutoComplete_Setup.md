This info comes from entries in Discord, and links to sites mentioned in Discord

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSC).
- Download the software here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Took defaults on Select Additional Task
- Install. (ex: Install path C:/program files/VSCode/ )
- Launch VSC

## 2. Install the Python Package for VSC
- Download the add-one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
- This includes Python Language, Pylance and Jupyter

## 3. Add IronPython Typings
- Download the IronPython stubs from @Gui_Talarico github: https://github.com/gtalarico/ironpython-stubs
- Unziped the files into /VSCode/ironpython-stubs-master

## 4. Restart VSC (Alt-F4 to close)

## 5. Configure json settings in VSC
- In VSC  file > Preferences > Settings (or Ctrl+comma if you’re on windows 10).
- Under the Settings tab, enter “python.autoComplete.extraPaths” into the Search Settings box (no quotes).
  - Click on the “Edit in settings.json” link/button.
  - Add the following into the line provided:  "…\\VSCode\\ironpython-stubs-master".
  - Use the full path for your environment, include the quotes and double slashes.
  - Hit CTRL-S to save the changes.
  - Close the “settings.json” editor.
- Click on the “Clear Setting Search Input” icon that is on the far right of the Search Box.
- Under the Settings tab, enter “python.analysis.extraPaths” into the Search Settings box (no quotes).
  - In the String Item area, add the following: ...\RazorEnh\Config
  - Use the full path for your environment, no quotes, no double \
  - Click the OK button.
- Hit CTRL+S to save the changes, then ALT+F4 to exit VSC, then restart VSC.

## 6. Open a new file and add the following code
Test File to verify from
```py
from AutoComplete import *
Misc.SendMessage("Test MSC. AutoComplete working!", 33)
```

## 7. Verify that Intellisense is working
- Check for some of the RE API, like Player or like Misc.SendMessage.
- Try to comment/uncomment the line of code of the "import", you should see the colors change on the Misc.SendMessage line, as the Intellisense is applied and removed.

## 8. Save the file into your ER Script folder.

## 9. In the Scripting Tab of ER, Add the file you created in the ER Script folder

## 10. In the …\RazorEnhanced\Lib directory
- create a empty file named AutoComplete.py
- Save the file.
- This allows RE to find an empty AutoComplete.py file and not trigger an error, while still allowing VSC to find the AutoComplete.py file in the RE Config folder.

## 11. Test the execution of the test file that was created in VSC, and make sure it runs successfully in ER.

## 12. In each of your scripts you want to edit in VSC, add the import:
```py
from AutoComplete import *
```

## 13. I was able to add the …\RazorEnhanced\Scripts folder to the VSC Explorer by using File>Open Folder.
